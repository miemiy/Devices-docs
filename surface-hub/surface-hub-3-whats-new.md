[!INCLUDE [Hub MTR Scope](includes/hub-mtr-scope.md)]

## Introduction

Surface Hub 3, available in 50-inch and 85-inch models, delivers an inclusive hybrid collaboration experience through the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Designed end-to-end by Microsoft, Surface Hub 3 is the [premier all-in-one hybrid meeting and collaboration device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxasUd908k&t=1s) built for modern work. It brings advanced features and **AI-powered interactive experiences** to elevate collaboration and create an engaging, efficient environment, empowering hybrid teams to be more productive together than ever.

## Hybrid meetings that include everyone

Dissolve boundaries for hybrid teams with a device designed to make meetings more inclusive. Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows provides a premium, AI-powered experience certified for Microsoft Teams. Users can seamlessly join meetings across different platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Google Meet (anticipated October 2024).

- [Surface Hub Smart Camera](surface-hub-smart-camera.md) offers remote participants the best possible view of the room.  
  - Ultra-wide 136-degree field of view with high-quality glass optics and a low-light sensor.
  - Surface Hub Smart Camera integrates with **IntelliFrame** to keep participants in view as they move or interact with content, ensuring a dynamic and inclusive meeting experience.<sup>1</sup>
- **One-touch join**: Join Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Webex meetings with a single tap on the home screen.
- **Facial expressions and body language** are vividly rendered on the 4K touchscreen display, delivering a more natural and inclusive experience for remote and in-room participants.

### AI-powered Speaker Recognition

Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows introduces **AI-powered Speaker Recognition**, enhancing the meeting experience by identifying individual voices in the room (for participants who have opted in through voice enrollment). With clear consent and privacy in mind, this feature ensures that meeting contributions are accurately attributed to each speaker, supporting better follow-up and collaboration. Background noise is suppressed, creating a clearer, more focused environment for all participants.

- **Speaker Recognition**: Identifies participants' voices in the room by analyzing vocal characteristics, ensuring individual contributions are tracked. 
  - **Voice enrollment**: End users can easily create a voice profile via [aka.ms/voiceprofile](https://aka.ms/voiceprofile), allowing their voice to be recognized in meetings. 
  - **IT administration**: Admins can manage voice and face enrollment for specific users, groups of users, or an entire organization, ensuring secure and accurate identification. To learn more, see [Overview of voice and face enrollment](/microsoftteams/rooms/voice-and-face-recognition).

- **Facilitator integration**: Powered by Speaker Recognition, Facilitator<sup>1</sup> (targeted for public preview in Q1 2025) takes meeting notes in real time, tracks decisions, and automatically creates follow-up tasks, helping teams focus on discussions instead of manual follow-ups.

- **Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, adhering to strict privacy guidelines and regulatory requirements for data protection. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

### Center-of-table console support

Microsoft [announced at Ignite 2024](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/SurfaceITPro/enhancing-collaboration-with-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-surface-hub-3/4292453) that Surface Hub 3 will bring support for **third-party center-of-table consoles** in 2025, providing an additional option for controlling meetings. This new ecosystem of **Teams Rooms Certified Universal Consoles**, starting with hardware from MAXHUB, will allow consoles to be separately purchased and deployed with touch board Teams Rooms on Windows devices, starting with Surface Hub. This will enable users to manage meetings in a familiar way from the touchpad while seated at the conference room table. Not only will console support simplify meeting operations, including joining meetings, but it will also provide an entry point for wired content sharing from individuals’ PCs.<sup>2</sup>  Console support will make it easier to deploy Surface Hub 3 in a greater variety of meeting spaces, including front-of-room positions, and drive consistency across all Teams Rooms in your buildings. Universal Console support is targeted for general availability in **Q2 of 2025**.

Many customers ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition on Surface Hub 2S and the new [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform](/microsoftteams/rooms/). This new platform provides Surface Hub with a modern, secure, integrated, and consistent Teams Rooms experience designed for hybrid collaboration. It powers new Surface Hub 3 devices, Surface Hub 2S devices upgraded with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge,** and Surface Hub 2S devices that have been software-migrated from the legacy OS, to the new platform.

| **Access to all new Teams Rooms on Windows features** | Limited updates and features tied to the Windows 10 Team OS, which reaches end of support on October 14, 2025. | Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows provides access to the latest Teams Rooms features and updates, including **AI-powered** capabilities and **Speaker Recognition** for enhanced hybrid collaboration. Any new hardware-dependent features will also be supported as applicable. |
| **Low-touch deployment**                     | Standard deployment processes.                                                      | **Windows Autopilot** enables low-touch deployment for Surface Hub, allowing rapid configuration and integration into your environment with minimal IT overhead. This feature is exclusive to Teams Rooms on Windows. |
| **Security**                                 | Supports automatic password rotation for the device account (resource account).      | Supports Conditional Access. We recommend setting the password for the resource account to never expire and implementing [Conditional Access and Intune compliance for Microsoft Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices) to control sign-in processes in shared spaces, ensuring compliance and protection. |
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supports a range of applications outside of Teams, including Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Edge, and third-party apps from the Microsoft Store. | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform focuses on streamlining the meeting experience. While it doesn't support additional apps such as Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Edge, or third-party apps directly on the device, users can easily share content from these apps running on their personal devices using [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings. For more app experiences, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to apps. |
| **Access to personal files & login**         | Users can log in to the Windows OS itself to access their personal meetings and files and create a personalized experience. | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform prioritizes shared use in meeting spaces. Users can easily share content from these apps running on their personal devices using [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings. For users needing constant access to personal content on Surface Hubs, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to personal content within perpetually signed-in app experiences. |
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires sign-in to access the Whiteboard, and all content is tied to the signed-in account.                             | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform simplifies Whiteboard access—no sign-in is required. Whiteboards are automatically saved to OneDrive when a user with a Work or School account from the same organization joins the meeting. This approach enhances collaboration while maintaining security, as Surface Hub doesn't retain access after the meeting ends. Whiteboards can also be preattached to the meeting or switched by non-Hub users during meetings for added flexibility. |
| **Escalate ad-hoc whiteboard to meeting and retain in meeting stage**               | Separate from the Teams meeting, requires sharing a link, or sharing from within the Whiteboard app for collaborators on Teams to open in a separate window.                                                                 | Ad-hoc whiteboards are seamlessly retained in the Teams meeting stage after escalating to a meeting and adding remote participants.

| **HDMI Ingest**                              | HDMI Ingest allows users to project their device screens into the dedicated Connect application via an HDMI cable.                                          | Support is coming in 2025 for connecting **Teams Rooms Certified Universal Consoles to Surface Hub**, which will thereby enable wired content sharing to the Surface Hub.<sup>2</sup> [Learn more here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/SurfaceITPro/enhancing-collaboration-with-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-surface-hub-3/4292453).<br><br>Although direct HDMI Ingest to the Teams Rooms experience isn't supported on the Surface Hub itself, users can still easily switch Surface Hub into HDMI or USB-C bypass mode using the onboard ports. Bypass mode allows Surface Hub to function as a standalone display when connected to an external device, bypassing the Teams Rooms interface.<br><br> Customers can also use [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings to wirelessly share screen content to Surface Hub running the Teams Rooms experience. |
| **Wireless screen sharing**                  | Supports wireless screen sharing into the dedicated Connect application via Miracast for quick content projection.                                          |Supports wireless screen sharing via [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d), available for seamless content sharing even when a scheduled meeting is not in session. Desktop Sharing also provides an easy way to share content from personal devices during a scheduled or ad-hoc meeting. These options facilitate a more consistent, unified sharing experience within Teams or improvised collaboration.|
| **DisplayPort video out**                    | Provides DisplayPort video out for connecting to external displays.                                         | DisplayPort video out (extend or duplicate) isn't supported natively in the Teams Rooms environment on Surface Hub. However, users who require this functionality can migrate to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md), enabling access to DisplayPort for presentations and extended display needs. |

### Surface Hub 2S on Windows 10 Team edition

Windows 10 Team edition, the legacy OS that was the default on Surface Hub 2S, remains supported until October 14, 2025, allowing time for customers to transition their Surface Hub 2S devices to the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Customers can choose to upgrade their Surface Hub 2S devices with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge**, which effectively turns their Hub devices into a Surface Hub 3. Or customers can use the [software migration option](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) to transition to Teams Rooms on Windows, although without access to capabilities like Smart Rotation, Portrait, Intelligent Audio<sup>1</sup>, and faster performance (which all require Surface Hub 3 hardware). To learn more, see [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can [software-migrate](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) your Surface Hub 2S device for free using the seamless software-migration option at any time before the end of support on October 14, 2025. Unlike the standard versions of Windows 10, there's no extended support option for Windows 10 Team edition when support ends.
